#### Gnome Extensions:

- **Panel corners**  
[Gnome Extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4805/panel-corners/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/aunetx/panel-corners)  
A GNOME shell extension to keep the old topbar corners, which were removed for GNOME 42. It also allows you to customize the rounded corners, even if you use GNOME 40 or 41.

- **Panel Workspace Scroll**  
[Gnome Extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6523/panel-workspace-scroll/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/PolyMeilex/gnome-shell-extension-panel-workspace-scroll)  
Switch workspace by mouse scroll on the panel.
In contrast to alternative extensions purpose of this one is to use the native scroll handler of gnome-shell, so workspace scroll should behave exactly the same as overview scroll or workspace indicator scroll.
